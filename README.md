i suck at coding and haven't done barely any for years so i'm gonna make a barebones text editor to get back in the groove and maybe learn something

### Goals
- semi customizable layout if at all possible (maybe not actually)
- i'd love to have some basic coding QOL functions (auto close parentheses, etc.)
- unscalable codebase

### Features
- text editing!
- budget vim mode
- poorly coded scrolling
- cursor x coordinate memory
